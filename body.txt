#### Description

Recent spikes in the Failed Message count for the TaskAssignmentChangedCalculateFinancialsMessage warranted further investigation into the cycle time for the three customers incurring the failures. The investigation confirmed our subscriber is indeed processing successfully for all three customers when run adhoc, albeit it is much slower than we'd like. One plausible explanation for the timeouts is when several hundred/thousand calculations are triggered for an enterprise, many requests to calculate financials are initiated and due to a higher thread count for the subscriber, the database server is getting hammered with requests, resulting in longer processing times, blocking events, and eventual timeouts.

A potential solution is to optimize the sprocs/functions involved in the calculation so they use less resources. Consequently, a slow filter in the WHERE clause of GetBillingRateSchedule_InternalByTask was identified as the culprit. Refactored this function to just return the Task, TaskAssignmentID and InternalBillingRateID for the TaskAssignmentSchedule_CalculatePlannedLaborFinancials sproc to then filter with the effective billing rate for the applicable TaskAssignment duration. This change reduced a 36 second execution time for GSI to ~1 second.

#### Description

In some languages the item browser tab's width can exceed the hardcoded width (900px) of the popup causing them to be hidden. This is due to the "responsive" design implemented during the rebranding, where "hidden" tabs will be moved to the "More" ddm when the tab widths exceed the available viewport space. Since the item browser popup does not contain this menu, the tabs become inaccessible unless the user increases the popup width manually.

#### Description
Story 118273 added the searchpath as a means to find and run dashboard reports if the StoreID of the report changes.  However the enterprise package name is a part of the searchpath and needs to be dynamically generated instead.

Acceptance
- Dashboard reports run in an enterprise created via template. The generated enterprise name is different than the templates source enterprise name.

@bscown , please review.  This update is required by changes I made in daptiv_ppm and daptiv_environment.

The new help path standard is http://[environment_fqdn]/Help/[product_module].

Also...  Look out, Daptiv!  Linus R. is committing code to the Ppm repo!  Haha.
- Added default value for FeatureFlagClientServiceSettings.hostUrl
- Revised ErrorResponseException to accept a string instead of a Uri, and properly handle when the string responseUri is an invalid format.

Merge released story to master.

#### Description

If the standard default workweek is defined to have less than 8 hours per day, the start date of a dependent task is sometimes calculated incorrectly if the dependency contains lag time.

The hours available for the day from the work calendar were being subtracted from the lag hours. Lag should be processed in whole days not hours. Also, lag created from the gantt chart was saving the lag time based on the work calendar. It now uses 480 minutes (8 hours) to be consistent with the ItemBrowser. Another story is being created to change the lag time in the ScheduleDependency table and its usages in code from minutes to days.

@sarudak @feliara8 Let's review together before you guys take over.

@greglboxer You should take a look at the recent changes I made.

#### Description

When launching the item browser from the enterprise dashboard and performing an action that requires communication with the parent window (ex: window.opener) a cross-origin security error is returned resulting in a blank page.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy

The error occurs because the enterprise dashboard's document.domain is set to daptiv.com whereas the item browser popup is set to the PPM webroot, violating the browsers same-origin policy. The overriding of the domain is required because the report viewer nugget iframe contents are rendered by the IBM Cognos stack in the daptiv.com domain in which the enterprise dashboard needs to match.

Unfortunately, the only fix I was able to identify was to basically swallow the exception and continue on with the action (window.close most of the time). One big side-effect is that confirmation messages will never be seen in the parent window if the enterprise dashboard is the referrer. However, launching the item browser from non-dashboard pages works fine.

#### Description

After global non-working time is added to the default calendar (or any change to the calendar is applied), when a project's dashboard is opened the user is notified of those changes and that they may affect the current plan of the project, allowing the user to decide whether he wants to run the scheduling engine against the whole project ad-hoc or not to fix the project plan.

**The same behavior is expected if any other calendar that affects the project is changed (i.e. a calendar that is used by some of the tasks in the project). But this is not the case.**

**_This change makes the code take into account the selected Task's calendar, so right workspaces are flagged._**

Test cased had into account (and fixed):

#### Description

It was under my understanding that our scheduled service GO pipelines had their own logic that queried for a list of provisioned enterprises then iterated over the endpoint, once for each enterprise. This assumption turned out to be false. Our endpoints need to be able to be run on all provisioned enterprises themselves.

#### Summary
This turned out larger than I had hoped so I made it a separate branch.  I wanted to test this shared logic so that's where all the extra interfaces/classes come in.  The YAGNI OnExceptionHandler could certainly be removed but it pertains to [Adam's comment](https://github.com/daptiv/Ppm/pull/4688#discussion_r69172429).  For certain, none of this is required so I suppose I'm fine if you don't want it at all.

#### Description

Calling the endpoint **..api/billingrates** results in _error 500_ due to timeout. This is because the way we are currently checking for permissions. We changed the code so the permissions are checked without overhead.

#### Description
as a daptiv sales engineer
I would like my templatized enterprise dashboard reports to function as soon as the new enterprise is generated so that the system can be demo'd without significant manual intervention

Note: This PR currently only supports reports located in the root folder.  The searchpath for a report in a subfolder needs to be found.
